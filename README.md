## About this program
This program is my introduction to Visual Basic and C#. I did play around with Visual Basic when it was pre-installed with Microsoft Office in the Microsoft Excel application, but I didn't make any programs, as I had no knowage, until now!

Anyways, this is my first project, and I'm happy with the result for this!

## The Story of Creating a Progress Bar Program
So, how did I get the idea for this project? Well, sometimes I think that people might want a progress bar running that can be controlled by them, and have it around just for fun. I even had dreams about this happening. Finally, in the early Sunday morning on November 13th, 2022, I created the project, and thus, the dream I had started to become a reality. While I do admit that I was going to add additional features like changing the Progress Bar status (as that is a feature since Windows 7), adding an indicator on the taskbar (another feature introduced in Windows 7), and switchable themes (adding a dark mode, and other color schemes), I decided simple is good enough. You are welcome to fork this project and add those features in.
